# Vault plugin
[Hashicorp Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault) plugin for [Netflix Lemur](https://github.com/Netflix/lemur).

## Prerequisites
1. Lemur 0.6.0
2. Hashicorp Vault 0.6.2 and above.

## Installation
1. Configure the [Vault PKI as Certificate Authority](Vault_CA.md).
2. To install the plugin, add the needed options to your lemur.conf.py file:

  ```python
  # Hashicorp Vault Plugin
  # Basic options:
  (REQUIRED) VAULT_URL = 'http://myvault.com:8200'
  (REQUIRED) VAULT_PKI_URL = VAULT_URL + '/v1/pki'

  # For HTTPS add the path to the certificate chain file on your Lemur server. This typically looks like /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.
  # If your Hashi Vault server uses a private certificate authority make sure the chain is present in the certificate bundle you specify.
  (OPTIONAL) VAULT_CA = '/path/ca/certificate'

  # Authentication options:
  (REQUIRED) VAULT_AUTH = 'TOKEN' | 'USERPASS' | 'CERT' | 'APPROLE' | 'LDAP' | 'GCP'
  VAULT_AUTH_PATH = 'authentication mounting point name' # Default to be the auth name
  
  # Token Authentication. It is not advisable to use the root token.
  VAULT_AUTH_TOKEN = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
  
  # LDAP/Userpass Auth
  VAULT_AUTH_USERNAME = 'myvaultuser'
  VAULT_AUTH_PASSWORD = 'Vault123'
  
  # TLS Certificates Auth
  VAULT_AUTH_CERT = '/tmp/crt.pem
  VAULT_AUTH_CERTKEY = '/tmp/key.pem
  
  # GCP Auth
  VAULT_AUTH_ROLE = 'myvaultrole'
  VAULT_AUTH_ACCOUNT = 'mygcpaccount'
  
  # AppRole Auth
  VAULT_AUTH_ROLE = 'myvaultrole'
  VAULT_AUTH_SECRET = 'approle_secret_id'
   ```

3. Deploy and install the files.

  ```sh
  # Install Vault Plugin
  cd lemur/plugins/
  git clone https://github.com/RcRonco/lemur_vault
  cd lemur_vault
  pip install .
  ```
  
4. Create a Certificate Authority in the lemur web interface and specify Hashi Vault in the plugin dropdown.
